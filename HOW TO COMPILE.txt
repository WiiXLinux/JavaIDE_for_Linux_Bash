(WORK IN PROGRESS V.00.1)

To compile this project you need an JDK

you should be in this projects home directory for these instructions


First compile the libraries needed to execute the Main program:

/PATH_TO_JDK_HOME/bin/javac -d ./bin ./src/lib/*.java

Then compile the Main itself:

/PATH_TO_JDK_HOME/bin/javac -d ./bin -cp ./bin ./src/bin/*.java

Now there should be everything compiled in ./bin
if you ls in there you should see ./bin/bin and ./bin/lib

What is left to do is configure the run.sh located in the first bin:
Replace "/PATH_TO_JDK/" to your jdk home directory

If not yet marked as executable you should chmod +x run.sh
