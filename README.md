LinuxShell Java IDE is an open source project that focuses on creating an interactive Java-based IDE
for java developers, that are not using a desktop environment.
For example, if you wanted to program in Java but your pc is too slow for Ubuntu Desktop, so you install
Ubuntu Server and this IDE to run on it.

How to install:
Download a release, unpack it and modify the run.sh in bin to use an JDK you have installed.
After that you should check if the file is set to be executable, if not just chmod +x run.sh

If you want to compile the project yourself, see "HOW TO COMPILE.txt"

Update:

Renderer seems very complete.
