___________________________________________________________________________________________________
LinuxShell Java IDE is an open source project that focuses on creating an interactive Java-based IDE

For example, if you wanted to program in Java but your pc is too slow for Ubuntu Desktop, so you install
Ubuntu Server and this IDE to run on it.
